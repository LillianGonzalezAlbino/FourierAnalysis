FourierAnalysis 
Abstract: 
In this research, we apply Fourier analysis as a tool to extract important features 
from a given dataset and use the features as predictors for a deep learning model. 
As opposed to other methods like the spacial model, the Fourier analysis provides 
precise information about the behavior of coalitions while not removing any of the data. 
Using spectral analysis it is easy to interpret and find the coalitions with the 
largest effects on the data thus making them good predictors. Since we will be working 
with large datasets, we will use a partitioning technique described in [1] that will 
reduce the size of our working set by  removing redundant information without altering 
the data.
